# Visualization_Projects

# Intro
This repository contains data visualization projects that I completed in past internships and academic courses.

There are several skill tracks used within these projects:

    Type 1: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair) + Streamlit

    Type 2: ArcGIS Pro + Excel

    Type 3: Tableau + Power BI
